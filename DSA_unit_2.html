    <h4>1)DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STACK AND QUEUE</h4>
<pre>
       STACK                          QUEUE
__________________________|_______________________________
i)Stack follow LIFO       |i)Queue follow FIFO operation
operation i.e - last-     |i.e - first-in-first-out.
in-first-out              |
ii)Insertion and delection|ii)Insertion and delection takes

iii)Stack perform two     |iii)Queue perform two operation

v)POP -> Used to delete   |v)FRONT -> Used to delete the

of the stack.             |


    <br><br>
    <h4>2)CIRCULAR QUEUE</h4>
    i)A circular queue is one in which the insertion of a new element is done at the 1st location of the queue if the last location of queue is full .<br>
    



    ii)a circular queue overcome the problem of unutiliged space in linear queue implemented as arrays .
    

    <h4>3)CIRCULAR QUEUE HAS FOLLOWING CONDITION </h4>

    i)front will always be pointing to the 1st element .<br>
    ii)If front = Rear the queue will be empty . <br>
    iii)each time a new element is inserted to the queue the Rear is incremented by one .<br>
    <pre>      Rear = Rear + 1</pre>
    iv)Each time on element is deleted from the queue the value of front is incremented by one .<br>

    <h4>4)INSERT AN ELEMENT IN CIRCULAR QUEUE ALGORITHM</h4>

    <pre>
        QINERT(QUEUE[MAX_SIZE],ITEM)
        Step 1 :- if(front == (Rear*1)% MAX_SIZE)
        write queue is overflow & Exit
        else
        take the value
        if(front == -1)
        set front = 0
        Rear = 0
        else
        Rear = (Rear+1)%MAX_SIZE
        [Assign value] Queue [Rear] = value
        [End if]
    Step 2 :- Exit
    </pre>

    <h4>5)DELETE AN ELEMENT IN CIRCULAR QUEUE ALGORITHM</h4>

    <pre>
    QDELETE(QUEUE[MAX_SIZE],ITEM)
    Step 1 :- if(front == -1)
	write queue is underflow & Exit
	else
	item = Queue[front]
	if(front == Rear)
	set front = -1
	Rear = -1
	else
	Rear = ((front+1)%MAX_SIZE)
	[End if]
Step 2 :- Exit
</pre>
<h4>6)DEQUEUE / DEQUE</h4>
i)A deque is a linear list in which elements can be added or remove at either end but not in the middle .<br>
ii)Deque is maintained by a circular array with pointers left and right which points two ends of deque .






<h4>7)INPUT RESTRICTED DEQUE</h4>
Allow insertion at only one end of the list but allow deletion at both ends 
<h4>8)OUTPUT RESTRICTED DEQUE</h4>
<h4>9)PRIORITY QUEUE</h4>
A priority queue is collection of elements such that each element has been assigned a priority such that the order in which elements are deleted & processed comes from the following rules . <br><br>
i)An element of higher priority is processed before the element with lower priority .<br>
ii)Two elements with the same priority are processed according to the order in which they were added to the queue .
